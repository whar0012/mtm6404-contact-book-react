# Contact Book

## Objective
Use what you have learned about React, React Router, and Firestore to create a contact book web application, which allows a user to see and search through all contacts, add new contacts, and edit and delete existing contacts.

# NOTES:

- For security reasons the db.js is not included within this repository due to containing sensitive information     that should never be made public.

- The db.js file is included in the ZIP file I submitted.

- I removed the app.jsx and app.css in favor of router.jsx and main.css.
